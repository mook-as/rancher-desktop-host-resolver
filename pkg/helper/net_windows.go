// GetDnsInterfaces returns network interfaces that have active DNS servers associated to them.
// The filtering criteria requests all address families using AF_UNSPEC since interfaces can have
// DNS server addrs for IPv6 and not IPv4, or vice versa. It further checks the operation status of the
// adapter's address to make sure it is up. The final filter is to remove all the addresses without a
// DCHP server, this filter eliminates interfaces that are not dynamically configured
// e.g. VirtualBox Host-Only Network, vEthernet (WSL)
